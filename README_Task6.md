# ✨ SkillFlex - Interactive Prototype (Task 6)

This repository contains the interactive prototype for the **SkillFlex Platform** built as part of **UI/UX Internship - Task 6**. The prototype showcases the core user flows with interactions, transitions, and microinteractions based on the high-fidelity UI screens from Task 4.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a functional, interactive prototype that demonstrates the **user flow**, **interface behavior**, and **microinteractions**. This task brings static UI to life and helps simulate real user engagement.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Figma** – For prototyping, animations, and linking screens
- **Smart Animate / Instant Transitions** – For creating natural movement
- **Prototype Preview** – For testing on desktop and mobile

---

## 🧭 User Flow Covered

> The interactive flow reflects the SkillFlex gig-hiring platform:

```
Home → Gig Details → Apply/Post a Gig → Success Modal
```
