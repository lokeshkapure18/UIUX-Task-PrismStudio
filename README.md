🌟 SkillFlex 

This repository contains the built for the SkillFlex platform as part of my UI/UX Internship Task 5. This system is structured using Figma styles and tokens, enabling **scalable, consistent, and efficient design
workflows for current and future UI/UX teams.

## 🧠 Research & Design Thinking

Before building the design system, I studied the following:

- 🎨 **Visual consistency** issues in job platforms like Naukri, Upwork, Freelancer
- 🧠 **User behavior** in dashboards and form-heavy interfaces
- 🔍 **Figma token systems** used in real-world products like Shopify Polaris, Atlassian, and Google Material
- 📐 Design principles: atomic design, modularity, accessibility

From this, I concluded that SkillFlex needed:
- Reusable design assets
- Structured tokens
- Clear naming for developer handoff
- A scalable foundation to support more designers in the future
